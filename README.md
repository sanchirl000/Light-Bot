# Light-Bot
I think that Light Bot was a little easy at the begining but then it started getting harder the higher the level you go. 
This game makes you think a lot and enough too understand what your doing and how to make it work.
The level that got me stuck was level 7 because I always had one blue sqaure left and i didn't know what o do an I kept trying.
